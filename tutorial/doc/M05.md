## M05001. Rounding Error Analysis (★)

```matlab
mat1 = (rand(7,4)- 0.5)*200;
mat1 = round(mat1,4); % round values to the nearest 4 decimal digits
```
You need to write a script that creates a variable named:  

(a) 'mat2', which is copied from 'mat1'. The first column of 'mat2' is rounded towards negative infinity. 'mat2' is a 7 x 4 matrix.  

(b) 'mat3', which is copied from 'mat2'. The second column of 'mat3' is then rounded to the nearest integer toward zero. 'mat3' is a 7 x 4 matrix.  

(c) 'mat4', which is copied from 'mat3'. The third column of 'mat4' is then rounded to positive infinity. 'mat4' is a 7 x 4 matrix.  

(d) 'round_error', which contains the absolute value of the difference between elements in 'mat1' and 'mat4'. 'round_error' is a 7 x 4 matrix.  
For example, 'mat1' and 'mat4' are [1.1 -2.1;-1.1 2.2] and [1 -2;-1 2], 'round_error' becomes [0.1 0.1;0.1 0.2].  

(e) 'error_means', which determines the mean of each row of 'round_error'. 'error_means' is a 7 x 1 column vector.  

(f) 'error_sum', which determines the sum of all values in 'round_error'. 'error_sum' is a scalar.  

(g) 'error_max', which determines the maximum value in each row of 'round_error'. 'error_max' is a 7 x 1 column vector.  

(h) 'error_min', which determines the minimum value in each column of 'round_error'. 'error_min' is a 1 x 4 row vector.

stat_2B = randi([20 45],4,1);
stat_3B = randi([0 8],4,1);
stat_HR = randperm(100, 4)'; % there is no same Home Run number.

```
The matrix 'stats' gives the information shown above about four baseball players performance over the course of a season. The data is represented by a dash (-) in the table above. Each row corresponds to a different player, and each column corresponds to a different statistic about the players performance. 'stats' is a 4 x 6 matrix. You need to make variables and index 'stats' to answer the following questions. 

(a) A single, double, triple and home run all count as hits. Create a variable named 'hits_a', which calculates the amount of hits each player has from the data in 'stats'. 'hits_a' is a 4 x 1 column vector. For example, if a row of 'stats' is [100 10 5 2 1 30], the  corresponding row of 'hits_a' becomes 18. **Please solve this problem using loop statements without using built-in functions. **

(b) You are going to solve the same problem of (a) using built-in functions without using loop statement. The values should be assigned to 'hits_b' and it is a 4 x 1 column vector. 

(c) A batting average is that the amount of hits each player has divided by the total number of batting attempts (At Bats or AB). 
Create a 1 x 4 row vector named 'bat_avg' from the data in 'stats', which includes the batting average of each player. **Please do not use loop statements.** 

(d) Create a variable 'hr_max' for the maximum number of home runs in 'stats'. **Please do not use loop statements. **

(e) Create a variable 'hr_leader' for the Player number who has the most home runs in the data 'stats'. For example, if Player 2 has the most home runs, 'hr_leader' = 2. **Please do not use loop statements. **

(f) You are going to solve the same problem of (d) and (e) without using built-in functions. The resulting values are assigned to 'hr_max_f' and 'hr_leader_f'. **Please use a loop statements.**

## M05003. Built-In Functions (★)

```matlab
mat2 = randi([-100 100],4,5);
mat_new = randi([-100 100],20,20);
```
You need to write a script that creates a variable named:

(a) 'vec1', which is a 1 x 5 row vector and contains the maximum values in each column of 'mat2'.

(b) 'vec2', which is a 1 x 4 row vector and contains the minimum values in each row of 'mat2'.

(c) 'val1', which is a scalar variable and contain the maximum value of all values in 'mat2'.

(d) 'val2', which is a scalar variable and contains the row index where the minimum value of the first column of 'mat2' is located. For example, the first column of 'mat2' is [1;2;3;0], 'val2' is 4.

(e) 'vec3', which is a 4 x 1 column vector and calculates the sum of all values in each rows of 'mat2'. For example, 'mat2' is [1 2; 3 4; 5 6], 'vec3' becomes [3;7;11]. 

(f) 'val3', which is a scalar variable and contains the sum of the first column of 'mat2'.

(g) 'val4', which is a scalar variable and contains the sum of all values in 'mat2'.

(h) 'val5', which is a scalar variable and contains the sum of all diagonal elements in 'mat_new'.  For example, if 'mat_new' is [1 2 3; 4 5 6;7 8 9], 'val5' becomes 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. 

(i) 'vec4', which is a 1 x 5 row vector and contains the median of each column in 'mat2'.

(j) 'val6', which is a scalar variable and contains the mean of all values in 'mat2'.

(k) 'mat3', which is copied from 'mat2'. All columns are then sorted, with the highest value in the top row and lowest in the bottom row. For example, if 'mat2' is [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9], 'mat3' becomes [7 8 9;4 5 6; 1 2 3].

(l) 'mat4', which is copied from 'mat2'. The third row is then sorted from the lowest on the left to the highest on the right. For example, if 'mat2' is [2 3 1; 6 5 4; 9 8 7], 'mat4' becomes  [2 3 1; 6 5 4; 7 8 9].

## M05004. Find Second Maximum (★★★)

```matlab
vec1 = randi([-20 20],1,100); % a 1x100 randomly generated vector with numbers raging from -20 to 20
```
Please write a script to find the second maximum element of 'vec1'. The second maximum element is assigned to the variable named 'max2'. 
For example, when 'vec1' is [1 3 10 2 10 9 3 9], 'max2' becomes 9 (Note that it is not 10). 
**Hint**: Use a sort function for this problem.

## M05005. Course Grading (★★★)

This program is to compute grades of students in a course.  Assume that there are 7 students in a class and they took 5 exams during the course. The weights of the exams that contribute the final grade are 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% in order. 

```matlab
ex1 = randperm(61,7)+38+rand(1,7); % generate exam scores of 7 students for exam1 without overlap. 
ex2 = randperm(61,7)+38+rand(1,7); % generate exam scores of 7 students for exam2 without overlap. 
ex3 = randperm(61,7)+38+rand(1,7); % generate exam scores of 7 students for exam3 without overlap. 
ex4 = randperm(61,7)+38+rand(1,7); % generate exam scores of 7 students for exam4 without overlap. 
ex5 = randperm(61,7)+38+rand(1,7); % generate exam scores of 7 students for exam5 without overlap. 

score = [ex1;ex2;ex3;ex4;ex5]; 
clearvars ex1 ex2 ex3 ex4 ex5
```
A variable named 'score' is a 5 x 7 matrix and contains scores for each exam and each student. For instance, score(3,4) is a score of the third exam for student 4 and let's say that ID of this student is 4. Another example, score(2,1) is a score of the second exam for a student having ID 1. 'score' is randomly generated and it ranges from 40 to 100. 'score' is generated using 'randperm' so there is no identical score within each exam.  

Please write a script to answer the following question. 

(a) create a variable named 'st_score_a' that contains a student grade who scored the highest in the second exam.

(b) create a variable named 'st_id_b' that contains a student ID. This student scored the lowest in the third exam.

(c) create a variable named 'num_c' that contains the number of students who get a score more than 60 in the fifth exam. 

(d) create a variable named 'st_score_d' that contains a student score. This score is the closest to the average score of the fourth exam. 
For example, assume that scores for the fourth exam are 91, 41, 92, 71, 43, 100, and 44. The average becomes 68.86. Thus, 'st_score_d' is 71. 
You can assume that there is only one closest number.

(e) create a variable named 'weight_score_e' that contains a 7 x 1 vector and its elements are the final scores. 
The final score for each student can be computed by the weighted summation of all scores. For example, assume that a student got 40, 50, 60, 70, and 90 from the exam in order.   

(f) create a variable named 'weight_modified_score_f' that contains a 7 x 1 vector and its elements are the modified final scores. In 'score', a score less than or equal to 50 is considered as 0 and a score more than or equal to 90 is 100. The final score is computed with the same way that you did in (e).

```
The matrix 'stats' gives the information shown above about four  baseball players performance over the course of a season. The data is represented by a dash (-) in the table above. Each row corresponds to a different player, and each column corresponds to a different statistic about the players performance. 'stats' is a 4 x 6 matrix. You need to use 'stats' to answer the following questions. 

(a) Create a variable 'so_stats', which is a 1 x 2 row vector. The first element is the minimum number of strikeouts in 'stats', and the second element is the index of the player with the fewest strikeouts in 'stats'. For example, if the fewest number of strikeouts is 64 and the player is Player 1, 'so_stats' = [64 1]

(b)  A single, double, triple and home run all count as hits. Create a vector 'hits_sorted', which sorts the total hits of each player in descending order from top to bottom. 'hits_sorted' is a 4 x 1 column vector.

(c) Create a matrix 'stats_hrsorted', which is to sort player's stats by having the players with the most home runs at the top, and the player with the fewest at the bottom.  'stats_hr_sorted' is a 4 x 6 matrix. **Hint**: Please find 'sortrows' in MATLAB.

(d) Create a variable 'stats_max', which lists the maximum number of Singles, Doubles, Triples and Home Runs in the matrix 'stats'. 'stats_max' is a 1 x 4 row vector.

(e) Create a variable 'stats_leaders', which lists the players who lead in each category in question (d). 'stats_leaders' is a 1 x 4 row vector.

(f) Create a variable, 'total_bases'. which calculates the total bases each player has successfully reached. A single counts as 1, a Double counts as 2, a Triple counts as 3 and a Home Run counts as 4. 'total_bases' is a 4 x 1 column vector.

## M05007. Word Finder Puzzle - Backward (★★★★)
I went to a Mel's diner with my daughter and saw an interesting word finder puzzle. Here is a sample. 

![banana_puzzleimage](img/M04001.PNG)

You are going to write a script to find a word from a puzzle. In general, this game is designed for searching multiple words. However, in this problem, you can write a program to find only one word, 'banana'. I wrote a code to create a word puzzle and insert 'banana' at **a random column or row locations**. This means, 'banana' is **not located at a diagonal direction.** 

The word can be read either down to up or up to down, or either right to left or left to right. You need to create a variable named 'word_loc' that contains a 6 x 2 matrix. 

Each row of 'word_loc' contains the location of each character of 'b','a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a' in order. Column 1 of 'word_loc' is the row location of the elements location, and column 2 of 'word_loc' is the column location of the elements location. Note that you need to use a MATLAB editor to solve this problem using debugger. Please copy the template codes to your editor. 

**Solution**

```matlab
word = 'banana';
n_word = numel(word);
word_db = double(word);

puzzle_size = 10;
puzzle = CreateWordPuzzle(puzzle_size, word);
disp('==Puzzle==');
disp(char(puzzle));

% find a word location
word_loc = zeros(numel(word),2);

% search columns
isRun = true;
for ii=1:puzzle_size
    col_vec = puzzle(:,ii);
    row_vec = puzzle(ii,:);
 
    for jj=1:(puzzle_size-n_word+1)
        test_loc = jj:(jj+n_word-1);
        
        test_word = col_vec(test_loc);
        if isequal(word_db, test_word')
            word_loc(:,2) = ii;
            word_loc(:,1) = test_loc;
        elseif isequal(fliplr(word_db),test_word')
            word_loc(:,2) = ii;
            word_loc(:,1) = fliplr(test_loc)';
        end
        
        test_word = row_vec(test_loc);
        if isequal(word_db, test_word)
            word_loc(:,1) = ii;
            word_loc(:,2) = test_loc;
        elseif isequal(fliplr(word_db),test_word)
            word_loc(:,1) = ii;
            word_loc(:,2) = fliplr(test_loc)';
        end
    end
end

% evaluate your answer
char_int = puzzle(word_loc(:,1) + (word_loc(:,2)-1)*puzzle_size);
fprintf('The word that you found is %s.\n',char(char_int'))

function puzzle = CreateWordPuzzle(puzzle_size, word)

puzzle = zeros(puzzle_size, puzzle_size);

% assign word set
n_word = numel(word);

is_forward = rand < 0.5;
word = is_forward*fliplr(word) + ~is_forward*word;

idx = randi(puzzle_size);
if randi([0 1])
    % cokumn vector
    str_idx = randi(puzzle_size-n_word+1);
    puzzle(str_idx:(str_idx+n_word-1),idx) = word';
else
    % row vector
    str_idx = randi(puzzle_size-n_word+1);
    puzzle(idx, str_idx:(str_idx+n_word-1),:) = word;
end

char_a = 97;
char_z = 122;
char_array = char_a:char_z;
non_word_char = char_array(~ismember(char_array, unique(word)));

emty_puzzle = ~puzzle(:);
puzzle(emty_puzzle) = ...
    non_word_char(randi(numel(non_word_char), [sum(emty_puzzle), 1]))';

clearvars num_PG num_GV num_CM num_B num_P num_V num_GS

equip_costs = [15 200 5 5 95 175 3];
```
The matrix 'ann_purchases' gives how many of each type of equipment has been purchased each year over 5 years. Each row of 'ann_purchases' corresponds to a different year, and each column corresponds to a different piece of equipment. The costs of the equipment is provided in 'equip_costs', a 1 x 7 row vector. The first element of 'equip_costs' is the price of a Pressure Gauge, and the last element is the price of a Gyroscope Sensor.

Write a script that creates a variable named:

(a) 'min_cm', which contains the fewest number of Concrete Moulds purchased during five years.  

(b) 'max_v', which contins the largest number of Venturi meter's purchased during five years.  

(c) 'min_yr_b', which contains the year when the fewest Batteries were purchased during five years. Note that if there are more than two minimum numbers, please assign the earliest year. For example, the fewest Batteries are purchased year 1 and year 2. You need to assign 1.   

(d) 'max_purchases_ind', which contains the year of when the highest number of every purchase.  'max_purchases_ind' is a 1 x 7 row vector. If the maximum items purchased is the same in multiple years, return the lowest year number that has the maximum items purchased.  Note that if there are more than two maximum numbers in each item, please assign the earliest year in each item.  

(e) 'max_yr', which contains the year with the maximum total number of items purcahsed during five years.  For example, 'ann_purchases' is [1 1 1 3; 1 1 2 4;2 2 2 3], 'max_purchase_yr' become 3 because year 1: 6, year 2: 8, year 3: 9. Note that if there are more than two maximum numbers, please assign the earliest year.   

(f) 'is_more_than_1200' which contains logical(1) if the total number of items purchased during five years are more than 1,200. Otherwise, assign logical(0) to 'is_more_than_1200'.  

We are going to compute the cost using the price for each equipmented provided in 'equip_costs'. 

(g) Create a variable named 'total_cost' which is a 5 x 1 column vector and determines the total cost of equipment in each year. Use the 'equip_cost' vector and 'ann_purchases' array to calculate the total cost.    

(h) Ever since year #3, all equipment prices have been increased by 10%. Compute 'total_cost_re' which is a 5 x 1 column vector and determines the revised total cost.  

(i) HST for all equipment is 13% except for Batteries. Batteries are tax free. Compute a scalar variable named 'total_hst', which is the total HST for all 5 years (Note: total tax does not mean total price). Use the original 'equip_costs' array, and not the one used in question (h).

## M05010. Making the Change (★★★)

![making the change](img/coin_paper_money.PNG)

You are making a script for a telling machine. If the money value is provided, your script computes the number of bills or coins. 
Always use bigger bills or coins first if it allows. The tellling machine has seven Canadian different bills/coins above. 
The output of your script is a 1 x 7 row vector named 'cad_change' that includes the number of bills/coins in the order above. 
For example, when 232 dollar is provide as an input dollar, 'cad_change' becomes [2 0 1 1 0 1 0].
Another example, when 68 dollar is provide as an input dollar, 'cad_change' becomes [0 1 0 1 1 1 1].
The input dollar named 'money' is randomly generated. 

**Solution**

```matlab
money = randi([30 500], 1);
cad_change = zeros(1,7);

cad_vec = [100 50 20 10 5 2 1];
rem_money = money;
for ii=1:7
    cad_change(ii) = fix(rem_money/cad_vec(ii));
    rem_money = rem_money - cad_change(ii) * cad_vec(ii);
end

fprintf('The input dollar is %d \n', money);
fprintf('The number of Canadian bills/coins are \n');
fprintf('100: %d, 50: %d, 20: %d, 10: %d, 5: %d, 2: %d, 1: %d \n',cad_change);
```

## M05011. Sorting by Distance (★★)

You need to sort a list of integer numbers according to the difference between the number and the target value.  The vector named 'vec1' is a 1 x 10 row vector and contains random integer values (without repetation). There are no values in 'vec1' that are the same as one another.  The target value named 't' is given as 3.6. Since the elements in 'vec1' are not repeated, the difference between each element and the target value (3.6) are different (which means that the difference in values are not repeated). The values in 'vec1' are sorted in descending order in terms of the absolute value of the difference between t and the corresponding elements in 'vec1'. Please assign the sorted values to 'vec1_sort'.  

For instance, if vec1 = [ 1 2 5 7 9 10], then 'vec1_sort' becomes [10 9 7 1 2 5]. 
(Since the absolute distances between t and elements in 'vec1' is [2.6, 1.6, 1.4, 3.4, 5.4, 6.4]. Thus their differences would be sorted in vec 2.)

**Solution**

```matlab
vec1 = randperm(100, 10)-30; % pick 10 values from -29 to 70
t = 3.6;

dist = abs(vec1-t);
[~, id] = sort(dist, 'descend');
vec1_sort = vec1(id);
```

## M05012. Bulls and Cows (★)

UW Bulls and Cows is a mind game, developed by Noreen. In the game, a random, 3-digit even number (Possible digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) is chosen, called a true number, and its values are compared to those of a test number. All rules are exactly the same as the original Bulls and Cows game that we studied in the lecture except the digits used and the number of digits evaluated. All three digits of the number are different. If any digit in the test number is the exact same value and in the exact same position as any digit in the true number, this is called a bull. If the digit is present in both the trial number and chosen number but is not in the same location, this is called a 
cow. 

Please note that both the test number and true number have every digit element separated into an array element. For example if the test number is 024, 'test_num' 
is actually [0,2,4]. A true number named as 'true_num' is given and a test number named as 'test_num' is also given. Please write a script to evaluate bulls and cows of 
a test number. The resulting bulls and cows are assigned to 'bulls' and 'cows'. 

**Solution**

```matlab
even_num = [0 2 4 6 8];
true_num = even_num(randperm(5,3)); % randomly generate a 1 x 3 vector in which elements are picked among even digits.
test_num = even_num(randperm(5,3)); % randomly generate a 1 x 3 vector in which elements are picked among even digits.

% bulls 
numb = 0; % number of Bull
for ii=1:3
    if true_num(ii) == test_num(ii)
        numb = numb + 1;
    end
end

bulls = numb;

% cows
numc = 0;
for ii=1:3
    for jj=1:3
        if true_num(ii) == test_num(jj)
            numc = numc + 1;
        end
    end
end

cows = numc-bulls;

fprintf('True number is [%d %d %d]. \n', true_num);
fprintf('Test number is [%d %d %d]. \n', test_num);
fprintf('Bulls and Cows that you found are %d and %d \n', bulls, cows);
```

## M05013. Simple Word Puzzle (★★★)

You are going to write a script to find a single word of 'banana' from a character vector named 'word_seq'. You need to create a 1 x 6 row vector named 'word_loc' that contains the location of each character in the word 'banana'.  'banana' is placed from left to right and at random location (six consecutive locations) in 'word_seq', which is a 1 x 30 row vector. 

For example, 'word_seq' is  
![sequence](img/vector_puzzle.png)
Then, 'word_loc' becomes [3 4 5 6 7 8]. Note that there are only lowercase letters. 

**Solution**
```matlab
num_seq = 30; % number of characters in 'word_seq'
word_seq = randi([97 122], 1, num_seq); % generate random numeric vectors corresponding to lowercase characters

word_bana = double('banana'); % convert 'banana' to a numeric vector
num_bana = numel(word_bana);

loc_b = randi([1 num_seq-num_bana+1]); % random location of 'b'
word_seq(loc_b:loc_b+num_bana-1) = word_bana; % place 'banana' to 'word_seq'

word_seq = char(word_seq); % conver the numeric word_seq to the character vector

clearvars loc_b

% Your script to find 'word_loc'

word_loc = zeros(1, num_bana);
for ii=1:num_seq-num_bana+1
    test_loc = ii:ii+num_bana-1;
    if isequal(word_seq(test_loc), 'banana')
       word_loc = test_loc; 
    end
end

fprintf('The word sequence is ');
disp(word_seq);

fprintf('The word that you find is ');
disp(word_seq(word_loc));
```
## M05014. Candy Store (★★)

Noreen owns a candy store, and she did a promotion on July 2. If customers applied for membership cards on that day, they would have a chance to win a prize. 10000 poeple applied for a membership card.
The prize will be awarded to only Five customers by order of application. The receivers are chosen based on their membership card number. 

The card number is 10 digits. To win the prize, the card number satisfy the following conditions:

* No '5' appears at all digits. 
* The sum of all digits is less than 40. 
* The largest digit is less than or equal to 8. 

Here are some examples:
The card numbers that satisfy the conditions are 
* 1234617812 
* 3212613212
* 6812143642

The card numbers that do not satisfy the conditions are 
* 1235617812 (not satisfying the first condition)
* 3212913212 (not satisfying the third condition)
* 6832743942 (not satisfying the second and third conditions)

A 10000 x 10 matrix named 'card_num_all' is randomly generated and each row represents a card number. 
```matlab
card_num_all = randi(10, 10000, 10)-1; % a 10000 x 10 matrix and its elements are generated from 0 to 9. 
priz_rs = zeros(1, 5); % index of receivers
```
Write a script to find the index of prize receivers and assign it value to 'priz_rs' in order, which is a 1 x 5 vector. 
In this problem, you must use a 'break' command so that the execuation is terminated once you find all five receievers. 
If you can't find five receivers (not probabilistically feasible), leave the element(s) as zero(s). 

**Solution**
```matlab
card_num_all = randi(10, 10000, 10)-1; % a 10000 x 10 matrix and its elements are generated from 0 to 9. 
priz_rs = zeros(1, 5); % index of receivers
% write your code here

num_id = 10000;

count_pz = 0;
for ii = 1:num_id
    test_id = card_num_all(ii,:);
    
    cond1 = true;
    for jj=1:10
       if test_id(jj) == 5
           cond1 = false;
           break;
       end
    end
    
    cond2 = sum(test_id) < 40;
    
    cond3 = max(test_id) <= 8;
    
    if cond1 && cond2 && cond3
        count_pz = count_pz + 1;
        priz_rs(count_pz) = ii;
    end
    
    if count_pz == 5
        break
    end
end

mat1 = randi([10 100], n);
mat2 = randi([10 100], n);
```
a) Create a mirrored row vector named 'vec1' where the second last element (n-1) is repeated n-2 times on both side of the middle element.  (Note that if n is 4 then vec1 = [1 2 3 3 4 3 3 2 1] or if n is 5 then vec1 = [1 2 3 4 4 4 5 4 4 4 3 2 1])

b) Create a 1 x n row vector named 'vec2' which has the sequence 2(3), 4(4), 6(5), 8(6)..., (2*n)x(n+2). 

c) Create a matrix named 'mat_c' which concatenates 'mat1' and 'mat2' in the third dimension.

**Solution**
```matlab
n = randi([4 20], 1); % n is a randomly generated number ranging from 4 to 20
mat1 = randi([10 100], n);
mat2 = randi([10 100], n);

## M05016. Alphabet Character Manipulation (★★★)

Note: refer to the ASCII table when solving this question: https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html
The following variables are created in advance using 'randi' and will be used for solving questions. 

```matlab
charvec_ran = char(randi([97 122], 1,200)); % a 1 x 200 randomly generated character vector
vowels ='aeiou'; 
alpha_char = char(97:122); % 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
```
Note that 'charvec_ran', 'vowels' and 'alpha_char' only contain lowercase letters. 

(a) Write a script to check how many vowels are contained in 'charvec_ran' and assign the resulting count to 'num_vowels'. 

(b) Write a script to find the character that appears most frequently in 'charvec_ran' and assign the corresponding character to 'max_char'. If the characters that appear the most are more than one, return the earlier character. (e.g., 'b' is earlier than 'c'). 

**Solution**
```matlab
charvec_ran = char(randi([97 122], 1,200)); % a 1 x 200 randomly generated character vector
vowels ='aeiou'; % vowel characters
alpha_char = char(97:122); % 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';

n_vec = numel(charvec_ran);
n_vow = 5;

%(a)
num_vowels = 0;
for ii=1:n_vec
    for jj=1:n_vow
        if charvec_ran(ii)==vowels(jj)
            num_vowels = num_vowels + 1;

## M05017. Making the Change: Many Money Values (★★★)

![making the change](img/coin_paper_money.PNG)

You are making a script for a telling machine. If the money value is provided, your script computes the number of bills or coins. Always use bigger bills or coins first if it is possible. The tellling machine has seven Canadian different bills/coins above. For example, when 232 dollars is provided as an input amount, the bills/coins needed are $100x 2, $20 x 1, $10x1, $2 x 1.

20 different money values are provided as an input. A 1 x 20 input money value vector named 'money' is randomly generated. You must find how many bills 
and coins are needed for each money value. The output of your script is a 1 x 7 matrix named 'cad_change' that includes the summed number of bills/coins for all 20 money values in the order: ($100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $2, $1). 

For example, suppose that there are two money values are inputted, 121 and 68. 
The bills and coins required for each of the money values are:
* $151:  $100 x 1, 50 x 1,  $1 x 1
* $68:  $50 x 1, $10 x 1, $5 x 1, $2 x 1, $1 x 1. 

The bills required to make up the money values are then summed into each respective bill category in 'cad_change'. Thus, 'cad_change' becomes [1 2 0 1 1 1 2].

**WARNING**: Do not sum up all the elements in 'money' and then solve for the bills needed to produce that result. You will automatically get the question wrong. 
This will be the result if you do so:
* $151 + $68 = $219
* $219: $100 x 2,  $10 x 1, $5 x 1, $2 x 2

And thus 'cad_change' becomes [2 0 0 1 1 2 0], which is a **wrong result**!!
Please note the difference between the two example vectors!

**Solution**
```matlab
n_money = 20;
money = randi([30 500], 1, n_money);
cad_change = zeros(1,7);

cad_vec = [100 50 20 10 5 2 1];

for ii=1:n_money
    test_money = money(ii);
    
    rem_money = test_money;
    test_change = zeros(1,7);
    for jj=1:7
        test_change(jj) = fix(rem_money/cad_vec(jj));
        rem_money = rem_money - test_change(jj) * cad_vec(jj);    
    end
    cad_change = cad_change + test_change;
end
```

## M05018. Making the Change: Bills Only (★★★)

![](img/M05018.PNG)

You are making a script for a telling machine. If the money value is provided, your script computes the number of bills or coins that are equivalent to the input money value. Always use bigger bills or coins first if it is possible. For this specific tellling machine, it only provides 5 different types of Canadian dollars bills shown above. 
Thus, you need to round off the input money value in such a way that the money value is converted to the closest multiple of 5.  For example, 
* $232 → $230
* $538 → $540
* $137 → $135
* $32 → $30

Then, you need to compute the number of bills needed to reach the given money value. The output of your script is a 1 x 5 row vector named 'cad_change' that includes the number of bills in the order above. For example, when $232 dollars are provided as an input amount, the bills needed are:
* 2 x $100
* 0 x $50
* 1 x $20
* 1 x $10
* 0 x $5
* 
Therefore, 'cad_change' becomes [2 0 1 1 0], which is an amount of $230. 

Another example, when $68 dollars are provided as an input amount, the bills needed are:
* 0 x $100
* 1 x $50
* 1 x $20
* 0 x $10
* 0 x $5 

And thus 'cad_change' becomes [0 1 1 0 0], which is an amount of $70. 
The input amount named 'money' is randomly generated. 

**Solution**

```matlab
money = randi([30 500], 1);

cad_change = zeros(1,7); % re-define for re-using the code

cad_vec = [100 50 20 10 5 2 1];
rem_money = money;
for ii=1:7
    cad_change(ii) = fix(rem_money/cad_vec(ii));
    rem_money = rem_money - cad_change(ii) * cad_vec(ii);
end

if cad_change(6)*2+cad_change(7) >=3
    cad_change(5) = cad_change(5) + 1;
end
cad_change(6:7) = [];

fprintf('The input dollar is %d \n', money);
fprintf('The number of Canadian bills/coins are \n');
fprintf('100: %d, 50: %d, 20: %d, 10: %d, 5: %d \n',cad_change);

mat1 = randi([10 100], n);
mat2 = randi([10 100], n);
```
a) Create a (3n-3) x 1 column mirrored vector named 'vec_a' in which n is repeated (n-1) times. n is the middle of the mirrored vector.  (Note that n is repeated for n-1 times in the middle. e.g., if n is 4 then vec4 = [1; 2; 3; 4; 4; 4; 3; 2; 1] or if n is 5 then vec4 = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 5; 5; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1])

b) Create a 1 x n row vector named 'vec_b', which has the sequence: n*3, (n-1)*4, (n-2)*5, (n-3)*6..., 2*(n+1), 1*(n+2).

c) Create a matrix named 'mat_c' which concatenates 'mat1' and 'mat2' in the third dimension.

**Solution**
```matlab
n = randi([5 20], 1); % n is a randomly generated number ranging from 5 to 20
mat1 = randi([10 100], n);
mat2 = randi([10 100], n);

vowel_vec ='AEIOU'; 
alp_vec = char(65:90); % 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
```

Note 'char_vec_ran', 'vowel_vec', and 'alp_vec' only contain uppercase letters. 

(a) Write a script to check how many vowels are contained in 'char_vec_ran' and assign the resulting count to 'num_v'. 

(b) Write a script to find the character that appears the most in 'char_vec_ran' and assign the corresponding character to 'max_char'.

If customers applied for membership cards on that day, they would have a chance to win a prize. 10000 poeple applied for a membership card. The prize will be awarded to only Seven customers by order of application. The receivers are chosen based on their membership card number. 

The card number is 10 digits. To win the prize, the card number must satisfy the following conditions:
* There is no '7' that appears at any digit. 
* The sum of all digits is greater than 30. 
* The smallest digit is greater than or equal to 2. 

Here are some examples:
The card numbers that **satisfy these conditions** are 
* 2234635832 
* 3232623282
* 6862943642

The card numbers that do not satisfy the conditions are 
* 1235617812 (not satifying the first and third conditions)
* 2222332223 (not satifying the second condition)
* 2232143142 (not satifying the second and third conditions)

A 10000 x 10 matrix named 'card_num_all' is randomly generated and each row represents a card number.

prize_rs = zeros(1, 7); % index of receivers
```

Write a script to find the index of prize receivers and assign it value to 'prize_rs' in order, which is a 1 x 7 vector. In this problem, you must use a 'break' command so that the execution is terminated once you find all seven receivers. If you can't find seven receivers (not probabilistically feasible), leave the element(s) as zero(s).

## M05022. Simple Word Puzzle (★★★)

You are going to write a script to find a single word of 'milkshake' from a character vector named 'word_seq'. You need to create a  9 x 1 column vector named 'word_location' that contains the location of each character letter in the word 'milkshake'.  Only one word ('milkshake') is be placed from top to bottom at a random location in 'word_seq', which is a 40 x 1 column vector. 

For example, if 'word_seq' is :

Then, 'word_location' becomes [2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10].
Note that there are only lowercase letters. 

**Solution**

```matlab
num_seq = 40; % number of characters in 'word_seq'

## M05023. Bulls and Cows (★)

UW Bulls and Cows is a mind game, developed by Noreen. In the game, a random, 3-digit odd number is chosen (with possible digits of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), called a true 
number, and its values are compared to those of a test number.All rules are exactly the same as the original Bulls and Cows game that we studied in the lecture 
except the digits used and the number of digits evaluated. All three digits of the number are different. If any digit in the test number is the exact same value and 
in the exact same position as any digit in the true number, this is called a bull. If the digit is present in both the trial number and chosen number but is not in the 
same location, this is called a cow. 

Please note that both the test number and true number have every digit element separated into an array element. For example if the test number is 173, 'test_num' is 
actually [1,7,3]. A true number named as 'true_num' is given and a test number named as 'test_num' is also given. Please write a script to evaluate bulls and cows of 
both of the test number. The resulting bulls and cows are assigned to 'bullz' and  'cowz'. 

**Solution**
```matlab
odd_num = [1 3 5 7 9];
true_num = odd_num(randperm(5,3)); % randomly generate a 1 x 3 vector in which elements are picked among odd digits.
test_num = odd_num(randperm(5,3)); % randomly generate a 1 x 3 vector in which elements are picked among odd digits.

% bulls 
numb = 0; % number of Bull
for ii=1:3
    if true_num(ii) == test_num(ii)
        numb = numb + 1;
    end
end

bullz = numb;

% cows
numc = 0;
for ii=1:3
    for jj=1:3
        if true_num(ii) == test_num(jj)
            numc = numc + 1;
        end
    end
end

cowz = numc-bullz;

fprintf('True number is [%d %d %d]. \n', true_num);
fprintf('test number is [%d %d %d]. \n', test_num);
fprintf('Bulls and Cows that you found are %d and %d \n', bullz, cowz);
```
## M05025 Matrix Manipulation using Loop Statements (★)

I went to a Mel's diner with my daughter and saw an interesting word finder puzzle. 
Here is a sample. 

![](img/M04001.PNG)
You are going to write a script to find a word from a puzzle. In general, this game is designed for searching multiple words.
However, in this problem, you can write a program to find only one word, 'mango'.
I wrote a code to create a word puzzle and insert 'mango' at a random column or row locations. 
The word is placed at either left-to-right or right-to-left in a row direction and at either top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top in a column direction.
This means, 'mango' is not located at a diagonal direction. 
You need to create a variable named 'word_loc' that contains a 5 x 2 matrix. 
Each row of 'word_loc' contains the location of each character of 'm','a', 'n', 'g', 'o' in order. 
The first column of 'word_loc' is the row location of the elements location, and the second column of 'word_loc' is the column location of the elements location.
Note that you need to use a MATLAB editor to solve this problem using debugger. Please copy the template codes to your editor.

## M05026 Amazon Sale: Loop and Selection Statements (★★)

Amazon Canada is having an online Summer Sale! 
The 4 categories you can shop from to get a discount are: Sports, Technology, Home Decor and Books. There is a $20 shipping fee for purchases in the Sports and Technology categories, there is a $10 shipping fee for purchases in the Home Decor category and shipping is free for Books. There are 20 people who are making purchases during the sale. 
Write a script to calculate the final amount for each of the 20 people shopping. You can avail the discounts if you meet the following conditions:
Amazon offers a special student discount. If you have UW student ID, your will receive a 10% discount.
There is a special discount for Prime subscription holders. If you have a Prime Subscription, you will receive a 15% discount. 
If you have a Mastercard, you will receive a 25% discount. 
If you have a Prime Subscription and a Mastercard and have spent over $500, you will get a 50% discount. 
Please note that two discounts cannot be combined. If a person is eligible for two discounts, the greater of the two will be applied. For example: Kasturi has a UW Student ID and a Prime Subscription. She will ONLY receive a 15% discount and not a 25% (10% + 15%) discount.
The final amount is calculated by subtracting the discount and then adding the shipping fee. Please note the discount is applied on the total amount spent only and does not apply on shipping fees.  
All data are stored in 'shopping_data'. Please assign final amount to be paid by each of the 20 people to a variable called 'final_amount' which is a 1x20 row vector.

```matlab
cart_total = randi([100 1000],1, 20); % 1x20 vector, the numbers represents how much each of the 20 people spent
category  = randi([1 4], 1, 20); 
% 'category'= 1: Sports
% 'category'= 2: Technology
% 'category'= 3: Home Decor
% 'category'= 4: Books
student_id = randi(2,1,20)-1; % 1x20 vector, 'student_id' = 1 if the person has a UW student ID, and 0 otherwise.
prime_sub = randi(2,1,20)-1; % 1x20 vector, 'prime_sub' = 1 if the person has a Prime Subscription, and 0 otherwise. 
mastercard = randi(2,1,20)-1; % 1x20 vector, ‘mastercard’ = 1 if the person has a Mastercard, and 0 otherwise. 

shopping_data=[cart_total; category; student_id; prime_sub; mastercard]; %5x20 matrix containing shopping data for each person
clearvars cart_total category student_id prime_sub mastercard 

num_people=size(shopping_data, 2); % # of columns (number of people);
final_amount=zeros(1,num_people); % your output variable that includes final amount paid by each person
```

## M05027. (Advanced) Donut Store (★★★)

A raffle will take place at Bianca's donut store. Each customer receives a 10 digit number on their ticket and 1000 people got raffle tickets.
The prize will be awarded to only five customers by order of application. The receivers are chosen based on their raffle ticket numbers. 
The ticket number is 10 digits. To win the prize, the ticket number must satisfy the following conditions:
The second and third digits are odd number.
The second last digit is greater than the last digit. 
sum of all digits is less than 40. 
The fourth and sixth digits are not equal to 4. 
For example, the person whose card number is either '5331121132' or '1352131175' will receive the prize if all 5 prizes were not taken by the other people registered before this person.
A 1000 x 10 matrix named 'card_num_all' is randomly generated and each row has a card number. 

```matlab
num_id = 1000;
card_num_all = randi(10, num_id, 10)-1; % a 1000 x 10 matrix and its elements are generated from 0 to 9. 
priz_rs = zeros(1, 5); % 1x5 vector containing index of receivers
```
Write a script to find the index of prize receivers and assign it value to 'prize_rs' in order, which is a 1 x 5 vector. 
In this problem, you must use a 'break' command so that the execution is terminated once you find all five receivers.
If you can't find five receivers (not feasible probabilistically), leave the element(s) as zero(s).

## M05028. Find the Number of Subsets (★★)

Kasturi is playing a number game where she is given a random set of numbers stored in a row vector called 'in_vec' of length 'n' (randomly generated).
```matlab
n = randi([1 30], 1); %random number between 1 and 30
in_vec = randperm(50, n); % 1 x n row vector of randomly generated numbers between 1 and 50 with no repeating elements
```
She is also given a value 'sum_val'. You need to compute the number of subsets of any two different numbers in 'in_vec' where their sum becomes 'sum_val'.
```matlab 
sum_val = randi([1 100], 1); %sum of two values within in_vec (between 1 and 100)
```
The number of possible subsets should be stored in 'num_set', which is Kasturi's final score. 'in_vec' is a row vector that contains integers without repeating elements. This means that if 'num_set' has a value which when summed with itself equals to 'sum_val', it does not count towards 'num_set' (a subset cannot have two same numbers). See example 4 for this explanation. Both 'sum_val' and 'num_set' are scalar values. 

Example1: 
```matlab
in_vec = [1 2 3 4 5];
sum_val = 7;
num_set = 2;
```
Then, 'num_set' becomes 2 because sum of (2, 5) and (3, 4) becomes 7 (sum_val). 
Note that (2, 5) and (5, 2) are the same and only count as 1 subset  in 'num_set'. 

Example 2:
```matlab 
in_vec = [3 11 10 2 1 12];
sum_val = 13;
num_set = 3;
```
Then, 'num_set' becomes 3 because the sum of (3, 10), (11, 2), and (1, 12) becomes 13 (sum_val). 

Example 3: 
```matlab
in_vec = [3 11 10 2 1 12];
sum_val = 16;
num_set = 0;
```
Then, 'num_set' becomes 0 because there is no set of two numbers of which summed becomes 16. 

Example 4:
```matlab
in_vec = [8 2 5 12 13 14];
sum_val = 10;
num_set = 1;
```
Then, 'num_set' becomes 1 because only (8,2) are the only set of numbers that are different and sum up to 10. (5,5) does not count for this problem.

## M05029. Earthquake Statistics (★★★)

```matlab
num_FS = randi([200 1000],5,1); % number of forershocks 
num_MS = randi([50 200],5,1); % numbrt of mainshocks 
num_AS = randi([500 1000],5,1); % number of aftershocks 
mag_MS = randi([6 10], 5,1); % average mainshock magnitude 
damg_RES = randi([100 1000],5,1); % number of damaged residential buildings 
damg_GOV = randi([100 1000],5,1); % number of damaged government buildings 
damg_HIST = randi([100 1000],5,1); % number of damaged historical buildings 

earthquake_stats = [num_FS num_MS num_AS mag_MS damg_RES damg_GOV damg_HIST]; % 5x7 matrix containing aftershock statistics
damg_costs = [10 15 20]; %damage cost per building (in thousands of dollars) 

clearvars num_FS num_MS num_AS mag_MS damg_RES damg_GOV damg_HIST %clearning variables
```
The matrix 'earthquake_stats' reports earthquake statistics over 5 years, the legend describes the types of statistics in the matrix. 
Each row of 'earthquake_stats' corresponds to a different year, and each column corresponds to a different statistic. 
The costs of the damage for each type of building (residential, government, historical) is reported in  in 'damg_costs', a 1 x 3 row vector. The first element of 'damg_costs' is the damage cost of residential buildings (in thousands of dollars), and the last element is the damage cost of historical buildings (in thousands of dollars).
Write a script that creates a variable named:
(a) 'total_quake' which is a 5x1 column vector that reports the total number of earthquakes (total number of FS, MS and AS) each year.
(b) 'max_mag_yr' which reports the year with the largest mainshock magnitude, note that if there are more than two maximum magnitudes, please assign the earliest year.
(c) 'is_yr4_over_mag' which has a value of logical(1) if the mainshock magnitude for year 4 is larger than the average mainshock magnitude over all 5 years.
(d) 'avg_damg_cost' which is the average cost of total damages for all building types for all five years, find the cost in tousands of dollars (ie. do not need to multiply 'damg_costs' by 1000).

## M05030. How many 'matlab' in a given sequence? (★★★) - 20 points

You are going to write a script to count the number of 'matlab' from a character vector named 'word_seq'. 
'word_seq' is a 1 x 300 lowercase alphabet sequence.  
The resulting value is stored in a variable named 'num_matlab'. 
For example, if 'word_seq' is: 

![](img/S21_Q2_1.PNG)

Then, 'num_matlab' becomes 3. 
Note that you should not use built-in functions of 'strfind' and 'count'.

## M05031. How many points are inside the box? (★★) - 15 points

![](img/Capture.PNG)

You are going to write a code to check how many 2D points are inside the region (in yellow). 
The x and y coordinates of 300 points are stored as a 300 x 2 array named 'pt_set'.
The first column of 'pt_set' contains x coordinates and the second column contains y coordinates for all points. 
The x and y coordinate of each point is randomly generated from the interval (0 20) in x and y directions.  
```matlab
pt_set = (rand(300,2)-0.5)*20 + 10; % a 300 x 2 array generated on the interval (0 20)
```
(a) Write a script to calculate a number of points inside the region (in yellow) and assign the resulting number to 'num_pt_in'. 
(b) Write a script to calculate a number of points outside the region (in yellow) and assign the resulting number to 'num_pt_out'. 
Note that the point on the border (the boundary of the box) is NOT considered as "inside".

## M05032. Alphabet Number Game (Advanced) (★★★) - 15 points

Kasturi and Bianca have created an alphabet number game. Each player has a 1 x 100 lowercase alphabet sequence. The player with the higher score wins this game. 
The score of 'a' is 0 and the score of each following letters gradually increases by 2. For example, 'b' becomes 2, 'c' becomes 4 and 'z' becomes 50. 
The final score is found by summing the scores of all 100 alphabet letters in a given sequence. 
50 players join this game. 

```matlab
alph_seq = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
player_seq = alph_seq(randi(26, 50, 100)); % 50 x 100 character vector 

clearvars alph_seq
```
Each row in 'player_seq' stores an alphabet sequence for each player containing 100 lowercase alphabets.
Here, a row index is considered as a player id. 
Who wins this game? Please find the winner's id (corresponding a row index) and store it in a variable named 'win_id'. 
Note that if the final score is tied, the lowest player id wins.

damg_costs = [10 15 20]; % damage cost per building (in thousands of dollars) 

clearvars num_FS num_MS num_AS mag_MS damg_RES damg_GOV damg_HIST %clearing variables
```
The matrix 'earthquake_stats' reports earthquake statistics over 5 years, the legend describes the types of statistics in the matrix. 
Each row of 'earthquake_stats' corresponds to a different year, and each column corresponds to a different statistic. 
The costs of the damage for each type of building (residential, government, historical) is reported in  in 'damg_costs', a 1 x 3 row vector. The first element of 'damg_costs' is the damage cost of residential buildings (in thousands of dollars), and the last element is the damage cost of historical buildings (in thousands of dollars).
Write a script that creates a variable named:
(a) 'min_total_quake_yr' which reports the year with the lowest total number of earthquakes (FS, MS, and AS are totaled for each year).
(b) 'num_yrs_over_800' which is the number of years with over 800 afterhocks.
(c) 'avg_num_damg' which is a 1x3 vector that reports the average number of damaged buildings for each building type over the five years (RES, GOV, and HIST in order). For example, if a total of 3000 government buildings are damaged over 5 years, that is an average of 600 government buildings. 
(d) 'total_damg_cost_asnd' which is a 5x1 vector that reports the years in order from the year with the lowest total damage costs to the year with the highest total damage costs (ascending order) 
Note that the total damage cost is a sum of damage costs for all three building types.

## M05035. Candy Store (★★) - 20 points

A raffle will take place at Kasturi's Candy Store. Each customer receives a 10 digit number on their ticket and 500 people got raffle tickets.
The prize will be awarded to only three customers by order of application. The receivers are chosen based on their raffle ticket numbers.
The ticket number is 10 digits. To win the prize, the ticket number must satisfy all the following conditions:
The sum of the fifth and sixth digits is greater than the sum of the first and last digits - in 1352131175, 4 is not great than 6, hence it does not satisfy the condition.
The third last digit is greater than 7 - in 1352131175, 1 is not great than 7, hence it does not satisfy the condition.
The card number contains less than three 9 - in 1952991175, the number has three digits that are 9, hence it does not satisfy the condition.
The third and sixth digits are not equal to each other - in 1952991175, 5 is not equal to 9, hence it satisfies the condition.
For example, the card numbers that satify all these four conditions are 1234512930, 0259192801 or 2910238901. 
A 500 x 10 matrix named 'card_num_all' is randomly generated and each row has a card number. 

```matlab
num_id = 500;
card_num_all = randi(10, num_id, 10)-1; % a 500 x 10 matrix and its elements are generated from 0 to 9. 
prize_rs = zeros(1, 3); % 1x3 vector containing index of receivers
```
Write a script to find the index of prize receivers and assign it value to 'prize_rs' in order, which is a 1 x 3 vector. 
In this problem, you must use a 'break' command so that the execution is terminated once you find all three receivers.
If you can't find three receivers (not feasible probabilistically), leave the element(s) as zero(s).
