# Quiz #1

## General description
This quiz is to evaluate your understanding of key concepts covered up to Module 2. This is an individual online live exam. We will make a general announcement through the WebEX Teams application (either voice or chat). You can ask questions anytime through the WebEX Teams application in person during the quiz. If you leave a message in a private chat window to your TAs or instructor, we will call you individually. You must solve all problems on your own and not discuss them with other people. During the quiz, you can only access (0) WebEx Teams (1) Course website, (2) MATLAB Grader, (3) MATLAB program in your computer, (4) Lecture/Tutorial videos, (5) Lecture slides, (6) MATLAB files that you have created while you study this course, and (7) Digital/Offline notes that you have made your own. Your digital note (in pdf or word) contains only texts and should not be a form of drag/drop website content. Your internet browser must only be used to access the course website, MATLAB Grader, or Lecture/tutorial videos. 

## Quiz Schedule
Group 1:  June 1 at 2:30 ~ 4:10 pm (EST).  
Group 2:  June 2 at 2:30 ~ 4:10 pm (EST).  
Group 3:  June 2 at 7:00 ~ 8:40 am (EST).   


## Submission & Grading
For Quiz 1, you must solve all questions within **100 minutes**. Since the length of the quiz is also set to accommodate students who have technology challenges (e.g., slow internet connection, computer), no extra time will be awarded. Note that the solution that is submitted after the designated due time will not be graded. Please submit the solution on time. You can access and solve the problems in any order. However, you can submit your answer **only one time**. Once you submit your solution for each problem, you can still view the problem but the “submit” button is inactive (meaning that you cannot re-submit a problem that you already submitted). Great care should be taken before you submit your solution. Thus, it is highly recommended that you run and check your solution in the MATLAB program installed on your computer. 

Please watch this video to understand how the quiz in the MATLAB Grader works:

A set of assessments (or tests) in the MATLAB Grader is designed in each problem for “preliminary” auto-grading but your solutions will be manually regraded to provide partial marks. Please do not be discouraged when you see that you have not passed all your tests tests. You need to include a concise comment in your scripts using ‘%’ (comment symbol) to obtain better partial grades. If the programming logic is correct based on the judgment on your comments, higher partial marks will be obtained. You can use any MATLAB built-in function at your own risk unless otherwise noted. However, if you misuse or misapply built-in functions that have not been covered in lectures or tutorials, you will not get partial marks from them. If you are unsure, please do not use a built-in function. The maximum score that you can get is 100. The score will contribute to the final grade with the corresponding weights outlined in the course website. 

## Technical interruptionm
kkIn general, any technical interruption (e.g., disconnect or unstable internet, laptop malfunction, unexpected personal circumstances) is your responsibility. You need to ensure that you have stable internet connection, and a stable laptop/desktop before you start any of your online quizzes. The corresponding quiz will not be rescheduled for the students that cannot retake it. If you have any concerns with a potential risk of technical interruption, please inform us in advance. 

However, students can request relief of a missed quiz **only one time**. At this point, we cannot estimate how many students will face up such technical interruption during all four quizzes. If the number of students having technical interruptions during quizzes is a considerable amount, students will have the opportunity to take another special quiz a week in advance or after the final quiz. The special quiz will cover all modules regardless of the scope of the quiz that the students fail to take. If its numbers are small, the weights for the corresponding quiz will be transferred to the final quiz. This approach is based on that all students will have no technical interruption during the final quiz. We will make another special announcement for the final quiz later. 

## Policy for Cheating 
University policies have a zero-tolerance towards plagiarism and you will get a grade of zero if your solution is evidently plagiarized. You will be reported to Engineering Undergraduate Associate Dean for academic offense. Both copiers and copyees are guilty of cheating and will receive an equal penalty. If you and your colleague copy the solution from the web, it is still considered as cheating because searching the web is not allowed during the quiz. Students who cheat will receive a zero mark on online engagement, which means that they will not receive extra points. Again, sharing your solutions to your friend is stupid and you will pay for it. 

**Good luck!**
