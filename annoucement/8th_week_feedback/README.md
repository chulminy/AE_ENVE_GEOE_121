# AE/ENVE/GEOE 121: Study Progress Survey (8th Week)

## Overview
We have provided a survey to monitor your study progress in this course. As you know, **Quiz 3 will be in 2 weeks** and, unfortunately, we cannot change the schedule due 
to the conflict dates with the other courses and different cohorts. Thus, we need to closely monitor your progress on this course. 

All 83 students responded to the survey and the [**results**](results) are presented below. The student feedback or comments were more positive than the ones from the 4th-week progress survey. Students felt like Quiz 2 is fair and reasonable, and more than half of the students think its level of the difficulty is moderate or easy. The major written comments were also similar to the survey results. 

However, still more than the half of the students ask for a few more days to catch up with the course schedule. We recently heard that the CEE students are overwhelmed due to course workloads. Thus, we decided to arrange the schedule again. First, we are going to delay the due date of HW #5 for three days (The first and second due dates will become July 12 and 19, respectively). Next, we will post a poker game problems as your HW #6 but you do not need to submit them. Additionally, we will give a full marks to all students for HW #6. However, this does not mean that you do not need to study the poker game problem(s). We will make at least one poker game problem in your upcoming Quiz #3 and/or #4. Thus, although you don't need to submit your solution, you have to study the problem. The instructor **will not** post the solution for HW #6 to the course website, so you can make the best effort to solve the problems with your colleagues or find better solutions through TA sessions or discussion posts on LEARN. 

The following new schedule has been posted on the course website. 

|HW|Topic|Start date|First due date|Second due date|
|:---|:-----|:----|:-----|:-----|
|HW #1|Module 01|May 11 |May 21 at 11:59PM|May 28 at 11:59PM|
|HW #2|Module 01 ~ Module 02|May 21 |May 28 at 11:59PM|June 04 at 11:59PM|
|HW #3|Module 01 ~ Module 04|May 28 |June 16 at 11:59PM|June 20 at 11:59PM|
|HW #4|Module 01 ~ Module 05|June 16|June 24 at 11:59PM|June 27 at 11:59PM|
|HW #5|Module 01 ~ Module 06|June 24|**July 12 at 11:59PM**|**July 19 at 11:59PM**|
|HW #6|Module 01 ~ Module 07|July 09|**No submission required**||

## Comments & Answers 

**In this section of this announcement, I have answered some major feedback to address your concerns.**

--------
* **Student 1:** I really appreciate having the stars for difficulty and points listed beside each question, really allows me to manage my time wisely. 
* **Student 2:** The quiz was pretty good, I liked the ability to submit more than once, it certainly saved me a lot of stress.
* **Student 3 :** I thought quiz 2 was fair. There were simple questions and there were also tricky ones that made you think logically and apply the concepts. I think the amount of questions and the time limit was good as well. I liked that we had 2 attempts, that really helped me fix small syntax errors. 
* **Student 4 :** I thought quiz 2 was fair. There were simple questions and there were also tricky ones that made you think logically and apply the concepts. I think the amount of questions and the time limit was good as well. I liked that we had 2 attempts, that really helped me fix small syntax errors. 
* **Student 5 :** I think the quiz is not too hard and not too easy
* **Student 6 :** Additionally, I am so thankful for the stars and points listed beside the question. It really helped me to manage my time better and focus on questions that are easier and worth more first. Please make every quiz like this one! - it was satisfyingly difficult but not overly frustrating

**CM:** Thank you. I appreciate your feedback on Quiz 1 to improve the following quiz questions, type, format, and length. Quiz #3 will be in a similar format.     

-------
* **Student 1:** QUIZ WAS STILL FAR TOO LONG. CUT IT BY AT LEAST 1 OR 2 QUESTIONS
* **Student 2:** I sometimes feel like I'm behind: am I the only one?
* **Student 3:** It would be nicer to have more time to write quizzes.
* **Student 4:** Quiz 2 was all complex problems, will the following quizzes follow this structure or will there be some basic function questions like we see on the assignments?
* **Student 5:** The quiz was a bit long and I definitely felt the pressure when doing it. It was a little overwhelming.
* **Student6:** The quiz was difficult. It would be great if future quizzes are a bit easier than this. Knowing that average of this class should be around 70 but still if was easier

**CM:** I'm sorry for your frustration. We will try to make better descriptions of the following quizzes. However, nothing in the quiz problems is new content, and all problems are very similar to the ones in homework assignments and tutorials. We will do our best to answer your questions regarding the unclearness of quiz questions during the quiz through WebEX. Please use WebEX Teams in-person chat next time.  

As mentioned, if the class average for Quiz #2 is more than 70, the following quizzes will not be easier than Quiz 2 [**Link**](https://github.com/chulminy/AE_ENVE_GEOE_121/blob/master/tutorial/Q1_Feedback_Answer.md#review-of-the-grading). 
Please do practice more on the problems in tutorial and homework assignments. Our TAs make live help sessions four days a week and answer your questions in LEARN every day.  

-------
* **Student:** Lectures were good enough since I never watch tutorials(To save time) and can do the quiz without problem.

**CM:** I think you have a programming background. However, I still recommend watching the tutorial videos because the quiz problems will be designed on the assumption that you study or solve them in advance.  

-------
* **Student:** Maybe increase online engagement back to 15 as it was at the start of the course

**CM :** Many students haven't gotten these points for the last two months. 8 points are still quite high, which has the similar weight of two homework assignments or your Quiz 1. 

-------

* **Student:** Editing of the videos would be helpful. For tutorial videos, it can be confusing when an incorrect solution is shown to us so in the case of this happening, editing the video and cutting that out would lead to less confusion.

**CM:** I edited my video a lot. The reason why I did not edit my incorrect solution or mistake is to teach or show how to correct my error. I'm sure you will have similar mistakes (actually making more mistakes than me) when you write your script. Debugging your code takes a large portion of programming but there is no way to teach them unless I make mistake. I understand you would want to see the final solution but letting you copy and paste the final solutions does not align with my teaching direction. 

-------
* **Student 1:** I think there are a lot of homework and tutorial questions. As daunting as it sounds I sometimes spend an entire day working through the same set of homework questions which is honestly mentally exhausting. With the length of each homework question, it does take a long time to complete them and it does hinder the load for our other courses.


* **Student 2:** Take it a little easy for late homework assignments. The due dates are pretty consistent (one every week), but there are always unexpected delays for other courses, and this course too. For example, the loop statement course took a little longer than expected, so I almost submitted the homework late. And of course this applies to other courses. Thanks! Also, the students really feel that you guys care about us, other classes don't ask for feedback like you guys, and you guys are very chill in making reasonable changes.

* **Student 3:** Easier assignments, As a student who is taking 6 courses right now, some of the assignment questions are very difficult and takes quite a long time to figure it out. So I hope it can be a bit easier so that we don’t spend too much time just on the assignment.


**CM:** Understood. This is not an easy course for some students, especially for those who are very new to the programming. However, during your academic years, this is the only and last time that you can formally learn programming. However, I agree that my course has to reduce some workloads. As mentioned at the beginning, we delay the due date for HW #5 and will not grade your HW #6. Hopefully, this change would help you reduce your workload. 

-------

* **Student:** It has been a bit difficult learning on our own and it has been hard to fully grasp all the concepts and apply them to different test questions. The assignments are a bit easier because there is much more time to think about how to do the questions, but when the time window is much shorter, it is much more difficult to correctly think of solutions.

**CM:** The questions were already covered in the tutorial and assignments. You will get used to solving such problems by doing more practice on those problems. The quizzes are open book and online exam. This format is not the best but the only way to evaluate your knowledge and progress on this course in this online environment.

-------
* **Student:** This course has been really good (great TAs!), but again, it takes me so long to figure out the questions, that I often see myself handing in solutions not fully finished because I can't get to them early enough, or they take too long to do.

**CM:** Yes. Our TAs are the best :thumbsup::thumbsup:|

-------
* **Student:** More examples available to help with homework. Find a better site for asking questions. The discussion board is horrible organizationally and doesn't get checked as often

**CM:** I used an issue board in Github last year but it was not successful. Agree. Discussion in LEARN might not a good system to ask and answer the questions. At this time, I can't change this tool. TAs and I are doing our best to answer your questions so please check it more frequently although it is not a good interface.  

-------
* **Student:** I understand how difficult it was it to completely change the structure of the course on such short notice. The course just really needs to be streamlined more. Maybe lectures l completely integrated with Matlab Editor. Live tutorials with screen sharing as well would be a great help, but of course the time difference makes that a challenge. I think that online learning is completely different than the traditional engineering learning and as a result requires a entirely different approach, which of course takes time to develop. However, I believe that the teaching team has optimized the course on such short notice.

**CM:** I understand your frustration. My initial plan was a live tutorial during my session if many people attend my session and would want to see such tutorials. Unfortunately, only one or two students showed up in my session so that's why I canceled the session. My recommendation is to attend TA sessions and if you need extra help, you can send me an email. I can either email you back or set up the a meeting to address your issues .  

-------
* **Student 1:** Possibly decrease the video time on lectures, we do not have much time for long lectures.

* **Student 2:** I would appreciate it if the lecture videos were split into shorter videos (ex instead of two 1h long videos, it could be four 30min videos). It is difficult to sit and learn for hours at a time when I am sitting in the same spot all day and night.

**CM:** There are time stamps on every video. You can only watch or navigate the topics that you are interested in or would study. A total hours of videos are actually shorter than the ones of regular in-person lectures. I can't make it shorter than the current length. I hope you can understand that I should spent triple or quadruple of the lecture hours to prepare, record and edit these lecture videos.

**Thank you for all the great feedback!!**
