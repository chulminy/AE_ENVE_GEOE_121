### Q1: What are ASCII values? <a name="Q1"></a> 
**Question:** I was curious where the numerical values come from that are assigned to each character? For example, why does char (97) return 'a'?

**Answer**: These numerical values for characters all come from the [ASCII Table](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html). The ASCII table assigns numeric values to all kinds of characters, not just alphabetical characters. For example, char(64) returns '@'. It is just a standard to encode a character to a unique numeric value.

### Q2: How to use the colon operator to step up or down? <a name="Q2"></a> 
**Question:** In the colon operator it iterates through values in the form first: step: last, what does the step value stand for and how does it help create the vector? 

**Answer**: The "step" literally means a "jump". 

This "jump" could go up the numbers by any value you give it. Ex [1: 3: 10] would jump 3 spots from 1-10 printing out 1 4 7 10. 

It could also go down the numbers by giving it a "-" sign. Ex [10: -3: 1] would jump 3 spots DOWN from 10-1 printing 10 7 4 1. 

### Q3: Indexing <a name="Q3"></a> 
**Question:** I was wondering when modifying a vector, I am still confused as to why a vector cannot be read by an index that does not yet exist, but it can be extended by referring to elements that do not yet exist? 

**Answer**: Very tricky to answer this question.... "Why a vector cannot be read by an index that does not yet exist" This is because we can't read the thing that doesn't exist. But we can "point out" or "refer" a new location although it does not exist. (It cannot be read because it does not exist, but we could create it by referring the space)

### Q4: Matrix Indexing <a name="Q4"></a> 
**Question:** Is it possible to explain with sentences what the code means for C3 and C4 ? I see that the output for C2-C4 is the same. 

```matlab
m1 = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]

c2 = m1(:,end);
c3 = m1(1:3,end);
c4 = m1(1:end,end);
```

**Answer**: C2, C3, and C4 are to explain how to access an entire column. 
C2  => m1(:, end)  ':' means accessing all values in the corresponding dimension
C3 => m1(1:3, end) 1:3 means accessing the values from the first to the third. Since the dimension of m1 is 3 x 3, 1:3 means accessing all values..
C4 => m1(1:end, end) 1:end mean accessing the values from the first to the end, which is the last location of the corresponding dimension. The last location is 3. Thus, 1:end here is the same as 1:3. The following diagram might also help:

As result, C2, C3, and C4 are the same!

### Q5: The "and" Operator <a name="Q5"></a> 
**Question:** I have a general question in terms of the and (&&) operator. Is it possible to include it more than once in a line of script?

**Answer**: Yes, It is possible because if you plug something like the following into MATLAB no errors appear.

```matlab
a = 1;
b = -1;
c = 3;
d = 4;
x = (a>-1)&&(a<3)&& (a<4);
```

### Q6: The "end" Operator <a name="Q6"></a> 
**Question:** I am trying to pick alternate values from a vector. If there is a vector

```matlab
values = [12  13  14  15  16  17];
```
a) why does this not work
```matlab
index = 1:2:end
answer = values(index)
```
b) and why does it only work if i do

```matlab
answer = values(1:2:end);
```

**Answer**: a) end is to refer the last value at each dimension. Thus, only when you use "end" inside the array, MATLAB knows the dimension of the corresponding array. Actually, the code doesn't reach to the line of "answer=values(index)" because the line of "index=1:2:end" has a syntax error like below.

b) That's how the end works in this script! If MATLAB see the "end " in the index section, it is considered as the last dimension of the corresponding dimension.

### Q7: Swapping Columns <a name="Q7"></a> 
**Question:** If we have a 5x6 matrix and we were to swap first and second rows, I'm confused about why we can't use comma to indicate the rows like such:
```matlab
matrix([1, 2], :) = matrix([2:-1:1], :)
```

**Answer**: "index(es)" that can refer or read values in a matrix is **a vector**!!! Here, you use a row vector where you can make either [1 2 3 4] or [1, 2, 3, 4]. Thus, in the left side, you do not have to use comma (,). Similarly, [2: -1:1] is a row vector, right so it works.  Note that [2: 6t6tg `*63
201-1:1], [2 1], and [2, 1] are all the same row vector.
