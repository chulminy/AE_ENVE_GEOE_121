### Q1: ‘max’ Built-In Function Syntax   <a name="Q1"></a> 
**Question:** I am wondering what does [~,id_row] means. I can only relate ~ to not equal, but I can't read the meaning here since we are trying to find the row index of the row with maximum non-zero elements. 

**Answer**:Let's assume that you want to find the location of the maximum value only and you don't need to have the maximum value.  
Then, [~, id] = max (vec) 
This means, you do not assign the maximum value to a variable because you are not using it.  

### Q2: The 'flip' Function  <a name="Q2"></a> 
**Question:** I'm just wondering what is the difference between flip, fliplr and flipud? And can I use flip to replace fliplr and flipud.

**Answer**:Please see the attached picture. Basically **fliplr** flips things right to left and **flipud** flips things in the up and down direction.As stated in the lecture, the flip function can also be used to flip matrices right to left or up and down if you include a dimension, flip(x, dim). For example, flip(x, 1) will flip the matrix up and down, flip(x,2) will flip the matrix right to left.
