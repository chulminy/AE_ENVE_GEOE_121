### M07-Q1: Debugging Functions  <a name="Q1"></a> 
**Question:** Is it bad practice in general to first create your function outside of the 'function' workspace? Let's say the function you are making consists of a loop, could you first create the loop, make sure it works as intended, before you put function [output] = Function_Name(input)? I understand the professor uses 'breakpoint' to debug the function variables and have access to that workspace but I have never used it to make a function so far and it has worked. 

**Answer**:Very good question! I will give you an example. Here is the M07040 solution.
![M07_Q1_1](../img/M07_Q1_1.png)

When you design this function, you would start with known M and opt value. You are commenting the script like this: 

![M07_Q1_2](../img/M07_Q1_2.png)

Then, you are manually assigning the input like: 

![M07_Q1_3](../img/M07_Q1_3.png)

Since you know the expected output of 'M_new', so you can debug your code using this format. Also, you can change the 'opt' value to check your script.  

If you include M at line 11 and  M_new at line 27 without ;, you can print out the M and M_new values in the commend window, which makes debugging easier. 
Then,  you first DELETE your manual input (this is a common mistake), and uncomment function header and input like this: 

(Tips: Comment and uncomment using Ctrl+R and Ctrl+T)

When you test your script,  you can use the test values before function header like mat1 and mat2. 

### M07-Q2: isequal vs. ==  <a name="Q2"></a> 
**Question:** I am wondering what's the exact difference and function for "iseuqal" and"==". There is a question in this week's assignment, and when I use "==" it said something like out of given space, but when I changed it to isequal, it worked well. Thus, I am wondering when we are supposed to use each of them.

**Answer**: If you are comparing character vectors with different size (1x 3 == 1x 4) so you will see the error message said, "Arrays have incompatible sizes for this operation".  

If you don't know the size of the array and they might have different sizes, I recommend isequal or strcomp for that operation. When the size of both values are different, these function simply produce false output.  

### M07-Q3: Function Advantages <a name="Q3"></a>

**Question:** Whats the advantage of using functions instead of for loops and what's a situation where localized functions are needed/ are better suited then scripts?

**Answer:** Functions allow you to reuse sections of code that you may need to repeat multiple times in your script (like the built-in functions). For loops don't really do the same thing as functions, so it's hard to really compare the two.

Local functions are used in your scripts, and attached at the end. If you need to preform the same operation multiple times on different variables, then functions can make your script shorter and reduce the chance of programming errors.
