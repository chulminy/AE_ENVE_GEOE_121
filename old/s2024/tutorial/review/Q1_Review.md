# CIVE 121 Quiz Review

### Suggested topics to focus review on:
- Array manipulation: deleting/swapping elements/rows/columns
- Array manipulation: concatenation 
- Array manipulation: performing operations on elements
- Array manipulation: creating sequences in vectors/matrices
- Pre-defining vector/matrix size using the 'zeros' or 'ones' functions
- Understand the difference between logical, double and character data types
- Logical operators: how they work and how to check if multiple statements are true/false
- M01 and M02 built-in functions and how they work
- Linear indexing: how it works in MATLAB with 2D matrices


### Suggested questions to focus studying on:
- M01015: Arthimetic, relational and logical operators
- HW2-Q2: Reshape arrays and swap rows/columns
- HW2-Q3/M02036: Alphabet number games
- M02004/M02029: Character type casting
- M02017/M02018/M02026: Creating sequences - not heavily covered in HW, so highly recommended
- Any other M01 and M02 questions that focus on topics you haven't fully understood yet


### Note:
- Your **LAST** submission (of the maximum of three you’re allowed to make) will be marked by the us, regardless of whether your code passed all the tests or not. **If you passed none of the tests you may still get part marks**, so make sure to **explain what your code is doing with comments**! Conversely, **if you pass all of a question’s tests but your logic is not correct you may still receive a 0 on the question**. Make sure you **avoid hard coding!**
