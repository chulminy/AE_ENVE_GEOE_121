## How long do you take the quiz?
100 minutes (2:30-4:10pm). You should start submitting your answer 10 ~ 15 minutes before the finish time. If many students submit their solutions in a last minutes, there will be a delay and your solutions might get submitted late.

## How many submission do you allow? 
Two per question. We will only grade your last answer. Please make sure that your script has no syntax or runtime errors. If the script has such error, you can't pass any of tests on the quiz (It doesn't mean that you will get zero on your grade because we will review your solution. But, we will deduce your mark because you did not fix the error).  

## Can you ask questions during the quiz?
