## Course Description
This course introduces computer programming for engineering students using MATLAB. MATLAB is an easy and readable programming language and is an excellent choice for those learning programming for the first time. This course will cover various topics including programming fundamentals, matrix operations, file I/O, and data visualization. Students who complete this course will gain a fundamental understanding of computer programming techniques and be able to operate, analyze, and visualize all types of data for future engineering studies. This course is not a MATLAB tutorial course. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer programming.  

This course includes lectures, tutorials, homework assignments, and quizzes:
* [**Lectures**](#course-outline) are to cover the major topics, emphasizing and discussing the important concepts with worked-out examples. 
* [**Tutorials**](#course-outline) are to assist students in the problems of course material and homework assignments.     
* [**Homework assignments**](#homework-assignment) are to provide practice for programming and evaluate your progress on the understanding of the course material.
* [**Quizzes**](#quiz) are to evaluate your knowledge and programming skills.   

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to  
* Develop MATLAB programming logic to solve problems 
* Compose working, efficient, and readable scripts in various ways
* Debug your code to identify and fix programming errors
* Identify suitable keywords to search for code snippets on the web
* Apply MATLAB to write your own program

## Study Guide
* Watch lecture video(s) of each module. 
* Solve problems in the course material and tutorials by yourself.
* Type and run all scripts of sample solutions in the course material and tutorial videos. Do not skim the code.  
* Make online engagement through [**LEARN**](https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/549056) or attend live help sessions.   
* Watch tutorial videos to check your answers for the problems.
* Employ an editor, Workspace browser, and debugging tool to solve the problems. 
* Work with your colleagues or ask help from TAs if possible. 

## Prerequisites
"Linear algebra" (AE/ENVE/GEOE 115) and "Calculus 1 for Engineering" (MATH 116) are prerequisites for this course, which you learned in the 1A term. If you are not familiar with these topics, please review corresponding lecture slides or tutorials.

* [**How to download and install MATLAB in your computer?**](tutorial/matlab_install)

## Course Textbook 
This course is not based on any particular textbook. However, lecture slides have been prepared using the following two references:
* Attaway, Stormy. *"MATLAB-A Practical Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving,"* Elsevier, 2018.
* Moore, Holly. *"MATLAB for Engineers,"* Pearson, 2017.

## Course Outline
All lectures and tutorials will be delivered using pre-recorded videos. All videos will be uploaded on a [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1nAPP8qUX90fanmEze3zLD41N-4lV25). For those who cannot access YouTube for some reason, video files will be shared in person. There are twelve modules and each module has 1 ~ 3 lecture and tutorial videos. The study load for each module is marked as the number of regular offline classes, which becomes a total of 24 classes. Roughly, students are expected to complete two classes every week. The expected time to finish (ETF) in each module is also provided to help students manage their time and keep up with lectures, assignments and quizzes. The course material will be posted as a PDF. Homework assignments and quizzes are all cumulative. The assignments and quizzes to be covered are based on the knowledge from the current and previous modules. For example, Quiz #2 will cover Module 01 to Module 05.

## Quiz
The quizzes will be delivered through the MATLAB Grader like tutorials or homework assignments. The major differences are a time limit and a limited submission (only one time). Although students do not pass pre-designed tests, they are not able to go back and edit their submitted solutions. Students are strongly encouraged to test and evaluate their solutions using a MATLAB editor before submitting. 
 
The students **must thoroughly prepare and be ready for taking the online quizzes** in advance, such as internet connection, computer peripheral devices, MATLAB access, laptop power status, personal circumstance. If they fail for some reason, the students should contact both the First-Year Engineering Office and the instructor and provide sensible reasons. If accepted, each student will receive a different set of quizzes with alternative questions that will cover the same content.

### Schedule  
|Exam|Topics|Date|Duration|Instruction|
|:---|:-------|:-----|:----|:----|
|**Quiz #1**|Module 01 ~ Module 02|June 01 or June 02 at 2:30 pm |100 minutes|[**Link**](annoucement/Quiz1_Description.md)|
|**Quiz #2**|Module 01 ~ Module 05|June 30 at 2:30 pm |110 minutes|[**Link**](annoucement/Quiz2_Description.md)|
|**Quiz #3**|Module 01 ~ Module 07|July 21 at 2:30 pm |120 minutes |[**Link**](annoucement/Quiz3_Description.md)|
|**Quiz #4**|Module 01 ~ Module 07, **09**, **11**|August 11|150 minutes|[**Link**](annoucement/Quiz4_Description.md)|   

## Policy for Cheating 
Students are encouraged to work in groups through collaborative learning only for homework assignments (not quizzes), but are required to submit their assignments individually. Students **must not share their solutions with other students**. The TAs will run software to check your scripts to detect plagiarism. Please do not think that you are able to deceive TAs. Although you pass all the problems in the MATLAB Grader, you will get a 0 grade if your solution is considered plagiarism with a zero-tolerance. You will be reported to Engineering Undergraduate Associate Dean as [**an academic offense**](#discipline). Both copiers and copyees are guilty of cheating and will receive an equal penalty. The penalty includes a zero mark on the corresponding homework assignment or quiz and a zero mark on online engagement, which means they will not receive extra points.  

Experience has shown that the students who copy friend's solutions **do not know how to make them different** and tend to not bother to change their friends' code. You should not trust your friends. Once you share the solution to your friend, you will likely get caught for cheating. Sharing your solutions to your friend will not benefit you or your friends, and overall is a dumb thing to do. 

What's worse, once you are cheating, your and your friend's previous assignments and solutions for quizzes will be re-evaluated. If evidence is shown that solutions are shared among them more than one time, you will fail the course and should retake it in the future. Do not feel easy if your cheating is undetected as it can still end up in a disaster. 

## Live Help Session
To accommodate online training, an instructor and two TAs will have live help sessions online. We will schedule a WebEX meeting during every help session so students can feel free to join the meeting without an appointment. These help sessions are scheduled during regular lectures and lab hours for two courses (AE and ENVE/GEOE 121). It becomes a total of 10 hours a week.    

The instructor will have a one-hour special help session for the students who will stay in different time-zones (e.g., Asia or Europe). The session will be scheduled early in the morning or late evening in the EST timezone. Any other student can use this help session as well. (Note that there is no instructor's session since June 22)

## Homework Assignment
The homework assignments will be designed using MATLAB Grader. This tool allows students instant feedback on the correctness of their solutions through the pre-designed testers. Thus, students can be highly motivated and inspired to persevere with completing the assignments.  
Problems in the homework assignments are more challenging than examples or problems in the course materials. Make sure to use concepts covered in live help sessions, as they provide hints and ideas towards the homework problems. Do not get used to writing your script directly to the MATLAB Grader only to pass the testers. Submission per problem will be **only be one time in the quizzes**. This means you do not have a chance to revise your code using the feedback from the MATLAB Grader. Thus, students are encouraged to use the MATLAB editor to prepare the problems in the quizzes.  

The **Late submission policy** allow students to have **a maximum one-week delay for two among the eight course assignments.** Students do not need to inform TA for their delay submission as well as the reason for the delay. The MATLAB Grader records your submission time. TAs will just count the number of delays in your homework assignments. TAs will inform the students who delay their submission a second time. If the number of delays is more than two, the third delayed homework will be zero. Students must pay close attention to deadlines. 

Unless there are significant health issues that may cause students to submit more than two of their assignemnts late, students should contact both the First-Year Engineering Office and the instructor and sufficiently explain why they are not able to submit **all three homework assignments** late. Thus, **please do not waste two chances for delay submission.** Again, **no late submission is accepted**, and any missed homework will be given a grade of 0. There is no exception.  

Note that TAs will check the time records of the latest submitted solutions. If the students revise their solution after the first due date, it will be considered as a late submission. 

### Schedule

*Students can start homework assignments if they are visible in the MATLAB Grader.*

* (07/05/20): All students will receive a full mark for HW #6.
* (07/13/20): All students will receive a full mark for HW #8. 
 
## Communication  
**All communication will be made through [**LEARN**](https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/549056) but all information related to the course will be posted on this course website. The instructor and TAs will frequently announce on LEARN after updating the web page.** Students are responsible for checking the course website regularly. LEARN will be only used for announcements and online Q&A discussion.   

In this course, the students are highly encouraged to engage in online discussions to create and facilitate a **collaborative learning experience**. Students are invited to ask questions and answer them, and share their knowledge and resources. Please direct your communications to the Discussion board on LEARN. However, if there is a good reason not to use the discussion forum (e.g., personal matters, a question that might reveal your solution of your report, etc.), please directly contact the TAs or use [live help session](#live-help-session) (private chat).  

**OLD**
> At the end of the course, TAs will evaluate the online activity of each student and measure > > an "online engagement" score. You will get a higher score if students 
> - Ask many and useful questions in LEARN or TA sessions
> - Comment on the colleague's questions
> - Share your solutions for examples or problems in the course material 

**NEW (05/11/20)**
The TAs and instructor realized that marking individual engagement scores are not feasible. The extra credit is to encourage students involving online discussion. However, it is not easy to gauge the activity as a score. Thus, we have created a simple rule to provide a fair score. Students must ask questions to receive credit. When students ask at least one question, they will receive 2 points in each month. Also, when students answer the question and the TAs or instructor endorse the answer, the student can also receive 2 points. Thus, students will receive up to 8 points in total. TAs or the instructor will ask a question as well. If the questions are trivial and easy to be answered from the course materials or lecture/tutorial videos, they are not counted. Please follow the instruction having Discussions on LEARN below:

 - Please be respectful of your peers, instructor, and others in your posts and comments.
- Asking good questions is another way of learning by summarizing and explaining what you know and do not know. Thoughtful questions and answers will help all students in this class. Before posting a question, please ask yourself whether you are truly stuck (meaning that the answers cannot be readily found on the web) and your questions are complete and legible.
- In addition, please check if the same question was asked before.  
- Inappropriate posts and comments will be immediately deleted and closed without notice.

## Grading  
The final grade will be based on the total marks earned from 8 homework assignments and 4 quizzes. Their grade components are provided as:

## Note
### Academic integrity
In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>

### Grievance 
A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/100">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

### Discipline
A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/131">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>

### Appeals
A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/100">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/99">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

### Note for students with disabilities 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

### Turnitin.com
Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
