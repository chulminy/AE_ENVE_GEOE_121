### Note 1:
I highly suggest having access to all of your previous work in this course while you write your final. Being able to copy and adapt your previous code will save you a lot of time. The expectation that you'll be able to save time by copying your previous code was factored in to how many questions have been given and the difficulty of the questions.

### Note 2:
There will be no HW7 solution video. If you have questions about HW7, or any other topic, you're welcome to come see me in the WEEF office or message me online. I likely won't be in the office as frequently during the exam period, so it's a good idea to check that I'll be there during any times you want to come in person.
