# Quiz #2

## General Description
**Quiz #2** is designed to evaluate your understanding of the key concepts covered in **Modules 1-4**. This is an individual, in-person exam held in CPH-1346 and E2-1792. **Your specific room and seat assignment will be provided on the quiz date.** You must complete all problems independently and are not allowed to discuss them with others. If you have questions, you may ask the TA proctors or the instructor at any time. The quiz consists of two parts: a written portion and a MATLAB Grader test.

### Guidelines for the Written Test
* This is a **closed-book exam**, but students are allowed to refer to a physical, single-sided cheating sheet.
* The duration for Q2 (Written) is **45 minutes**.
* The maximum score for the written test is **50**. 
* Turn off your wireless device(s) and place it in your backpack.
* The code section in each question is considered as a script file which is run in MATLAB. 
* Answer all questions in the designated areas. Do not use the back of pages for your answers.
* Do not separate pages.
* At the end of the quiz, **you will see the MATLAB Grader questions that you will solve the following session**. This is not a part of this written test. 
* Calculators and additional papers are not permitted.

### Guidelines for the Grader Test
* The Grader Test is open-book. You may access the following materials:
    * MATLAB Grader
    * MATLAB installed on the lab computer
    * Lecture slides (PDF format)
    * Your personal digital or handwritten notes
* The duration for Q2 (Grader) is **60 minutes**. 
* The maximum score for the grader test is **50**. 

**Permitted Programs and Tools:**

* Web browser (for accessing MATLAB Grader and MATLAB Online only)
* PDF viewer (for viewing your notes)
* MATLAB software on the lab computer

> Note: You may not use any other websites, search engines (e.g., Google), or shared cloud drives during the test.

**Device Use Policy:**
* You may use both the lab desktop computer and your personal laptop or tablet.
* Your laptop/tablet is only for viewing PDF notes. Only a PDF viewer should be used.
* All coding and answering must be done on the lab computer.


**Before the Test Begins:**
* If you are not using your laptop/tablet, copy all necessary PDF notes to a folder on the Desktop of the lab computer before the test starts.
* Turn off all messaging apps and background syncing programs (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive).
* Do not use shared or cloud-synced folders during the test.
* Accessing any folder other than the Desktop folder may be considered academic misconduct.

There are four questions:
- Q1-1 (★): 10 points
- Q1-2 (★): 10 points
- Q1-3 (★★): 15 points
- Q1-4 (★★★): 15 points
- Extra (★★★★): 10 points (can be transferred to your written test grade)

### Quiz Schedule
**AE/ENVE/GEOE:** June 23 at 03:30pm ~ 5:15 pm - 45 min (written test) + 60 min (grader test)

### Submission & Grading (MATLAB Grader)
For Quiz 2, you must solve all questions within the designated time. **Since the length of the quiz is also set to accommodate students who have technology challenges (e.g., slow internet connection, computer), no extra time will be provided.** Note that if your solution is submitted after the designated due time, it will not be graded. Please submit your solutions on time. You can access and solve the problems in any order. As promised, the number of stars to identify the difficulty of the problems will be provided to help students time management. You can submit your answer **unlimited times**. **We will only grade your final submission.** Great care should be taken before you submit your solution. Thus, it is highly recommended that you run and check your solution in the MATLAB program installed on your computer. Remember that we will **manually** grade your script at the end and review your programming logic. 

**Thus, although you pass the testers on the grader, you will get zero if your programming logic is not correct. There is no partial mark if you pass the tester with a WRONG logic.**

A set of assessments (or tests) in the MATLAB Grader is designed in each problem for “preliminary” auto-grading but your solutions will be manually re-graded to provide partial marks. Please do not be discouraged when you see that you have not passed all your tests. You need to include a **concise comment** in your scripts using ‘%’ (comment symbol) to obtain better partial marks. If the programming logic is correct based on the judgment on your comments, higher partial marks will be obtained. You can use any MATLAB built-in function at your own risk unless otherwise noted. However, if you misuse or misapply built-in functions that have not been covered in lectures or tutorials, you will not get partial marks for using them. Please do not use a built-in functions that we have not covered in our course if you are unsure of its applications. The score will contribute to the final grade with the corresponding weights outlined in the course website. 

Note that when you move to a different question without submitting your script on MATLAB Grader, the code will not be available when you reopen the previous question. Please do not work your script on MATLAB Grader. Instead, please use the MATLAB Editor to code your answers and save them in your computer.
