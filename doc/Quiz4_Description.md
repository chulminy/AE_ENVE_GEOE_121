# Quiz #4

## General Description
Quiz #4 is to evaluate your understanding of key concepts covered  in this course (**Module 1 - Module 7, Module 9, and Module 11**). This is an individual online live exam. You **must solve all problems on your own** and **must not discuss them with other people**. **We will make a general announcement through the MS Teams application (only chat) during the quiz.** You can ask questions anytime through the MS Teams application in person during the quiz. If you leave a message in a **private chat** window to your TAs or instructor, we will chat with you individually. Please do not ask questions on the General Channel chat where it is visible to everyone during the quiz.

During the quiz, you can only access (0) MS Teams (1) Course website, (2) MATLAB Grader, (3) MATLAB program in your computer, (4) Lecture/Tutorial videos, (5) Lecture slides, (6) MATLAB files that you have created while you study this course, and (7) Digital/Offline notes that you have made your own. Your digital note (in pdf or word) contains only texts and should not be a form of drag/drop website content. **Your internet browser must only be used to access the course website, MATLAB Grader, or Lecture/tutorial videos.** 

Remember, the students who copy friend's solutions do not know how to make them different and tend to not bother to change their friends' code. **You should not trust your friends.** Once you share the solution with your friend, you will likely get caught for cheating. **Also, you never discuss the problem with your friends during quizzes. That's also serious academic offense. **

There are seven questions including one ★★★★, four ★★★, one ★★, and one ★ questions. There is one more extra question (10 points) having ★★★★ difficulty. The problems in Q4 are slightly more difficult than prior quizzes. Remember that **you cannot solve the problems without studying all modules.** For example, you cannot solve the problem involving string data type without studying Module 11. Remember that the quiz problems are designed on the assumption that you complete homework and tutorial problems and watch all videos posted on the course website. 

## Quiz Schedule
Group 1:  **August 12 (Thursday)** at 2:30 ~ 5:00 pm (EST).  
Group 2:  **August 12 (Friday)** at 7:00 ~ 9:30 am (EST) for the student who stay in Asia or Middle East.   

## Submission & Grading
For Quiz 1, you must solve all questions within **150 minutes**. **Since the length of the quiz is also set to accommodate students who have technology challenges (e.g., slow internet connection, computer), no extra time will be provided.** Note that if your solution is submitted after the designated due time, it will not be graded. Please submit your solutions on time. You can access and solve the problems in any order. As promised, the number of stars to identify the difficulty of the problems will be provided to help students time management. 

You can submit your answer **unlimited times** and we only grade your "best" score answers, not the last one. Since the problems in Q3 are hardly corrected by chance, there is no reason to restrict the number of submissions. 

Again, please make sure that your script has no syntax or runtime errors. If the script has such error, you can't pass any of tests on the quiz (It doesn't mean that you will get zero on your grade because we will review your solution. But, we will deduce your mark because you did not fix the error).  

A set of assessments (or tests) in the MATLAB Grader is designed in each problem for “preliminary” auto-grading but your solutions will be manually re-graded to provide partial marks. Please do not be discouraged when you see that you have not passed all your tests. You need to include a **concise comment** in your scripts using ‘%’ (comment symbol) to obtain better partial marks. If the programming logic is correct based on the judgment on your comments, higher partial marks will be obtained. You can use any MATLAB built-in function at your own risk unless otherwise noted. However, if you misuse or misapply built-in functions that have not been covered in lectures or tutorials, you will not get partial marks for using them. Please do not use a built-in functions that we have not covered in our course if you are unsure of its applications. The maximum score that you can get is 100. The score will contribute to the final grade with the corresponding weights outlined in the course website. 

Note that when you move to a different question without submitting your script on MATLAB Grader, the code will not be available when you reopen the previous question. Please do not work your script on MATLAB Grader. Instead, please use the MATLAB Editor to code your answers and save them in your computer. 

## Technical interruption
In general, any technical interruption (e.g., disconnect or unstable internet, laptop malfunction, unexpected personal circumstances) is your responsibility. You need to ensure that you have stable internet connection, and a stable laptop/desktop before you start any of your online quizzes. The corresponding quiz will not be re-scheduled for the students that cannot re-take it. If you have any concerns with a potential risk of technical interruption, please inform us in advance. 

Fortunately, students can request relief of a missed quiz **only one time**. At this point, we cannot estimate how many students will face up such technical interruption during all four quizzes. If the number of students having technical interruptions during quizzes is a considerable amount, students will have the opportunity to take another special quiz a week in advance or after the final quiz. The special quiz will cover all modules regardless of the scope of the quiz that the students fail to take. If its numbers are small, the weights for the corresponding quiz will be transferred to the final quiz. This approach is based on that all students will have no technical interruption during the final quiz. We will make another special announcement for the final quiz later. 

**Good luck!**
