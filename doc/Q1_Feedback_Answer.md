I designed this course so that **the final class average ranges from 75 to 80**. I assume that you receive a full mark from homework assignments, attendance, preassessement, and online engagement if you desire the final grade above average. This is the bare minimum for students who take this course if they are willing to learn from this course. They contribute 34% of your final grade. This is definitely not a small number.

Let's assume that you receive 50 from all quizzes (actually very low scores). That will become 35% of your overall grade, and your final course average becomes 69. Now letâ€™s consider a scenario where you receive an average 70 from your quizzes, then your final grade becomes 83. Although you received low scores on the quizzes, they do not drastically affect your final grade because you get the basic marks from the homework assignments, attendance, preassessment, and online engagement. If you receive over average 80 on quizzes, you will get over 90 in your final grade. I hope you understand this grading mechanism. 

I understand you are not happy about the difficulty of the quiz problems. However, it is not hard to pass the course or achieve a descent final grade if you submit all homework assignments on time and receive a full mark from online engagement considering that our quizzes do not hold as much contribution as they normally would. Also, in doing this, we can give an advantage to the students who steadily study this course. Your efforts will pay off!

## Major changes based on students' feedback
* Kahoot questions will be posted on a course website a day or two before the class. 
* The first three lab questions will be open a day or two before each lab so that students can solve them in advance.


## Advice to the Students 
* Please read the course syllabus and quiz instruction carefully. Please read them before taking the quiz.
* **Remember that the quiz problems are designed on the assumption that you complete homework and tutorial problems.**
* If you want to review model answers for quizzes or homework, please ask TAs to review your scripts and show the answers.   
* To get prepared for the quizzes, you are able to solve all tutorial and homework assignments following [the study guideline](https://github.com/chulminy/AE_ENVE_GEOE_121#tutorial).
